# Data Analysis with Stocks
For my “Stock Market Analysis and Prediction” project, I tapped into The Investors Exchange (IEX) API to fetch live market data and performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis and visualization in Python. I developed techniques to assess a stock’s historical risk profile and then applied a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast its future price movements. Through this workflow, I combined real-time data processing, statistical modeling, and intuitive visualizations to uncover trends and quantify potential outcomes.

Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

All data used in this project is from the IEX Developer API platform loaded using `pandas-datareader`. The iexfinance provides real time fin-data from IEX endpoints, and historical time-series data. 

This repository includes the `.ipynb` file with the code and the [report](https://nbviewer.org/github/WilliamKwanProgramming/stock-data-analysis-prediction/blob/main/stock-market-analysis.ipynb)

Thank you!

This project was curated in Fall 2024.
